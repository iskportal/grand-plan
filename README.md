# Grand Plan

Open-Knowledge Foundation's Grand Plan (code name: *Axiom*), represents the most comprehensive attempt to re-imagine and re-construct the entire infrastructure of human knowledge creation, validation, and distribution using modern, decentralized, and open-collaborative technologies. 
# About This repository

The repository functions on multiple levels: as a systems engineering document detailing the interconnected software platforms and technologies required; as a strategic roadmap outlining the phased implementation of a complete ecosystem; and as a vision statement articulating how decentralized, open-source principles can be applied to solve fundamental problems in academic research and education.

Structured as both a technical deep-dive and accessible overview, the document bridges the gap between abstract ideals of knowledge democratization and concrete implementation details. It provides stakeholders—from developers and researchers to investors and institutions—with a clear understanding of how each component contributes to the larger mission while maintaining technical rigor in its specifications.

The document is designed to evolve as a living blueprint, incorporating feedback from the academic community, technological developments, and real-world implementation learnings. It serves not just as a plan, but as a collaborative framework for building consensus around a new paradigm for knowledge work.

# Plan Summary

The plan serves as the architectural blueprint of our attempt to change the dynamics of knowledge workflows and intellectual property development. At its core, the Grand Plan is an **ecosystem transformation strategy** that moves academic research from centralized, gatekept, and often inaccessible systems toward an open, collaborative, and economically sustainable network. It's built on the recognition that knowledge creation is inherently collaborative, yet current systems create artificial scarcities and barriers that slow scientific progress and limit participation.

Unlike previous solutions to the problem of modern academia--which address a partial solutions, Open Knowledge Foundation recognizes the fact that academic infrastructure and knowledge is a distributed, interconnected phenomena. Therefore, one cannot truly decentralize knowledge without addressing the problem as a whole, which includes but is not restricted to knowledge validation, data standards, identity systems, economic incentives and technical infrastructures simultaneously.

The plan, weaves together cutting-edge technical solutions, with social innovations. While the first includes the libraries, platforms and software, the latter emphasizes on new forms of peer-review, educational monetization, reputation systems and knowledge as *free market*. It understands that sustainable change requires both technological capabilities and aligned human incentives.

Rather than demanding immediate abandonment of existing systems, the plan provides a migration pathways and integration bridges that allow researchers and institutions to gradually transition while maintaining their current capabilities. This ensures such revolutionary change acceptable by the community, and achievable. 

## Knowledge As Free Market

Knowledge has value and it should be granted to the producer themselves. By creating a genuine value for all participants the plan creates sustainable economic flows rather than relying on philanthropy or government funding alone. It also shifts the perspective from *research is the paper* to *paper is a byproduct of research* as it allows micro developments in fields be apparent and economically valued.


Traditional academic publishing involves artificial scarcity around knowledge distribution, where journals capture the economy of research while researchers receive only career advancement tokens (prestige, citations, h-index). We invert this model by enabling researchers to directly monetize their knowledge contributions through multiple streams: educational distribution, community engagement and knowledge validation, and research itself. Our ecosystem values every meaningful contribution, it rewards the flow and progress instead of milestones. Academic knowledge work involves enormous amounts of "invisible labor"—peer reviewing, mentoring, code debugging, data cleaning, methodology refinement—that receives little recognition in traditional systems. By tokenizing all forms of knowledge contribution, we ensure that the researcher who spends time making their work reproducible, the expert who provides thoughtful peer review, and the educator who creates clear explanations all capture value proportional to their impact.

Rather than waiting for peer-review and publication, researchers can immediately offer their insight, tools, discoveries to the community. We believe the right approach to Knowledge is one with free market attributes. Market mechanisms naturally surface the most valuable contributions, attracts or repulses funds and collaboration as well as continuous validation.

Review and publish mechanism in the current state of scientific development is weak, and inefficient, when our understandings change fast, and the technologies progress with fast pacing a review should be live and growing, dialogue should be visible and extensible and the community should validate itself. 

The research funding marketplace eliminates traditional grant gatekeepers, allowing direct connection between knowledge producers and those who benefit from their work. Industry partners can fund specific research problems, students can support educators whose content helps them learn, and researchers can invest in tools and datasets that advance their own work. This creates multiple alternative funding pathways independent of institutional politics or power and geographical privilege.

Brilliant insights can emerge from any corner of the world, but current systems systematically undervalue knowledge from researchers outside prestigious institutions. Our decentralized market allows knowledge to be valued based on intrinsic merit rather than solely institutional prestige, creating opportunities for global knowledge arbitrage where undervalued insights can find their appropriate market value.

This economic model transforms research from a zero-sum competition for scarce publication slots into a positive-sum ecosystem where every valuable contribution to human knowledge generates returns for its creator, while accelerating overall scientific progress through aligned incentives and reduced barriers to collaboration.

By creating genuine value for all participants—researchers get better tools and fair compensation, students get interactive education, institutions get enhanced capabilities, and society gets faster scientific progress—the plan creates sustainable economic flows rather than relying on philanthropy or government funding alone.

## Open-Collaboration

Open-Collaboration is well-practiced in software development, and perhaps revolutionized it forever. These principles in our opinion is also reachable in the context of academia, knowledge creation and intellectual property itself. Despite that a careful attention to the unique requirements of research quality, intellectual honest and sustainable economic is needed.

By applying the principles of Open-Collaboration, we aim to build the next-generation on the values that would let them co-operate, communicate and influence using a modern method.
